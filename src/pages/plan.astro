    <h1 class="text-center">26-Week DSA Plan</h1>
    <p>This is my structured roadmap for ~26 Weeks of DSA prep. Split into two phases with weekly topics. I'll update statuses and links as I go.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Phase 1: 18 weeks (Foundations)</li>
      <li>✅ Phase 2: 8 weeks (Mastery)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1–18)</h2>
    <p>Goal: Build understanding of 17 LeetCode Explore Cards (~85–100 questions). ~2–2.5 questions/day with revision weeks.</p>

    <h2>Phase 2: Mastery (Weeks 19–26)</h2>
    <p>Goal: Medium–Hard LeetCode patterns for FAANG-level readiness (~220 questions). 2 questions/day over 8 weeks with real interview patterns and revision.</p>

    <h2>Revision Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      At the end of every week, I will do a dedicated revision session. When I initially solve problems, if I find them hard to solve, I will put them in <strong>Revision Block 1</strong>. During weekly revision days, I will focus on solving Revision Block 1 problems.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If I can solve them confidently, I will move them to <strong>Revision Block 2</strong>.</li>
      <li>If not, I will leave them in <strong>Block 1</strong> for another cycle.</li>
      <li>At the <strong>end of each month</strong>, I will tackle <strong>Revision Block 2</strong>.</li>
      <li>If I can solve them then, I will remove them from the list, showing I have truly learned them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This layered revision system will help me repeatedly practice the hardest problems until they stick.
