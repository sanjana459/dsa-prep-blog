## ✍️ Notes

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in coding interviews. Understanding their memory layout and traversal patterns helps solve a variety of problems efficiently.

Key takeaways:

- Use extra space to store prefix sums for quick range queries.
- Use sliding window for subarray problems with constraints.
- Understand time and space tradeoffs for naive vs optimized solutions.
