## 📌 Week 1 Goals
- Understand static and dynamic arrays
- Practice common patterns (prefix sum, sliding window)
- Build confidence with interview-style questions

---

## 🧩 Patterns Covered
- Prefix Sum
- Sliding Window

---

## ✅ Problems Solved
1. Two Sum (LeetCode Easy)
2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LeetCode Easy)
3. Subarray Sum Equals K (LeetCode Medium)

---

## ✍️ Notes

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in coding interviews. Understanding their memory layout and traversal patterns helps solve a variety of problems efficiently.

Key takeaways:

- Use extra space to store prefix sums for quick range queries.
- Use sliding window for subarray problems with constraints.
- Understand time and space tradeoffs for naive vs optimized solutions.
