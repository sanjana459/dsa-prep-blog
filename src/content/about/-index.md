Hi, I’m **Sanjana**, someone who loves solving problems and building projects or solutions for questions that truly matter. I’m an associate member of the International Environment Forum, where I get to collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. I believe there’s something to learn from everyone and never miss a chance to try something new. The best way for me to wind down is simply spending time with my family and friends, and enjoy watching documentaries and thriller shows.
