# 🔁 For Loop and Beyond

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **For Loop and Beyond** – my 153-day blog series documenting a structured journey through Data Structures & Algorithms.

This project is more than just problem-solving. It’s about building discipline, recognizing patterns, and collecting insights that go **beyond the loop**—towards clean thinking and interview readiness.

I’m writing one post per week for 26 weeks, each focused on a topic like arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Posts include patterns, solved problems, notes, and links.

Built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, the blog is fully static, fast, and hosted on Vercel.
