# 🔁 For Loop and Beyond

Hey there! 👋  
Hi there,  
Welcome to **For Loop and Beyond** - a 153-day blog series where I am documenting a structured journey through Data Structures and Algorithms.

This isn’t just about solving problems. It’s about building consistency, recognizing patterns, and sharpening your thinking for interviews and real-world development. Each week focuses on a different DSA topic, with notes, patterns, and problem breakdowns.

The blog is built with Astro and Tailwind CSS. It's fast, fully static, and hosted on Vercel.
